# Utilizing-unstructured-data-for-business-intelligence

Nowadays, the volume of data is increasing rapidly. In addition, unstructured data comprises the vast majority of data. Accordingly, the large volume of information,the highly hectic business environment and the fact that most enterprises cannot utilize the unstructured data pave the avenue for further research. Specifically, our thesis examines effective ways to search and derive insights from non-structured data in the context of Business Intelligence (BI) for enterprises, especially for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). This includes data acquisition, cleansing, formatting, text extraction, mining, natural language processing (NLP), automatic text summarization and sentiment analysis.  Moreover, our research focuses on information from various online platforms and social media such as SEC Edgar database, TripAdvisor,YouTube  and  Hellenic  Chamber of Hotels.   In particular, our thesis mainly deals with text summarization of financial disclosures and web data analysis of Greek restaurants from the region of Thessaly. Finally, the purpose of this study is to harness valuable unstructured data from various web sources in order to support the modern needs of enterprises.
