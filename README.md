Nowadays, the volume of data is increasing rapidly. In addition, unstructured datacomprises the vast majority of data.  Accordingly, the large volume of information,the highly hectic business environment and the fact that most enterprises cannot uti-lize the unstructured data pave the avenue for further research. Specifically, our the-sis examines effective ways to search and derive insights from non-structured datain the context of Business Intelligence (BI) for enterprises, especially for Small andMedium Enterprises (SMEs).  This includes data acquisition, cleansing, formatting,text extraction, mining, natural language processing, automatic text summarizationand sentiment analysis.  Moreover, our research focuses on information from var-ious online platforms and social media such as SEC Edgar database, TripAdvisor,YouTube  and  Hellenic  Chamber  of  Hotels.   In  particular,  our  thesis  mainly  dealswith  text  summarization  of  financial  disclosures  and  web  data  analysis  of  Greekrestaurants from the region of Thessaly.  Finally, the purpose of this study is to har-ness valuable unstructured data from various web sources in order to support themodern needs of enterprises.
